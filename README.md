This project is a C++-based Student Attendance Management System designed for efficient attendance tracking. It allows teachers to sign in, select classes, mark attendance, and track student progress. Attendance records are stored in a file, enabling teachers to monitor monthly and multi-month attendance percentages. The system is console-based, ensuring simplicity and ease of use.
